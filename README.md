## My books

This code sends request to the following [link.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/57424153-ana?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read)

It goes to my list of books which i've read over the years and gets data about *book title, author, rating* as well as *book cover url* from the list.

After that, it writes all the information in the already created .csv file and moves on to the next page, until all the data is collected.

<sub> Hope you find your favorite books among mine! ^_^ </sub>
